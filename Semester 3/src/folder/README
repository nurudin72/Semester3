This started out as a homework assignment, and I became interested in the
different maze creation algorithms, so here we go.  The backtracker algorithm
was that homework assignment, and hopefully as I explore these algorithms, my
code will be come much cleaner.

So far there is:

    - The Recursive Backtracker algorithm
    - The Recursize Division algorithm
    - Ellers algorithm
    - Growing Tree algorithm



NOTE:
    To get Prog8 to function, it needs to be compied and run with
    a reference to the acm.jar package, availible at http://jtf.acm.org/
